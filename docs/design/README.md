# Design Documentation

This directory contains design decisions and technical documentation.

## Design Records (DRs)

Design Records capture significant technical decisions with:

- The problem and what was decided
- Why this approach was chosen
- Trade-offs and alternatives considered

See [dr-writing-guide.md](./dr-writing-guide.md) for complete guidelines.

## Structure

- `dr-writing-guide.md` - How to write Design Records
- `design-records/` - Individual DR files (dr-NNN-title.md)
- `design-records/README.md` - DR index
- `design-records/superseded/` - Replaced DRs

## When to Create a DR

Create a DR when the decision affects architecture, has alternatives, involves trade-offs, or future developers will ask "why?". Don't create DRs for trivial details or standard practices.

See dr-writing-guide.md for detailed criteria and examples.
