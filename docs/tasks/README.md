# Task Documents

This directory contains task documents that guide AI agents through different types of work.

Task documents provide focused instructions for specific activities like design work or implementation work. They're meant to be read by agents when starting a particular type of task.

## Available Tasks

### [design-phase.md](./design-phase.md)

Guides agents through design work - asking questions, exploring alternatives, making decisions, and creating Design Records.

**When to use:** Starting design work, making architectural decisions, documenting trade-offs.

**Key activities:**

- Ask probing design questions
- Explore alternatives and trade-offs
- Create Design Records (DRs)
- Maintain DR index

### [implementation-phase.md](./implementation-phase.md)

Guides agents through implementation work - translating design decisions into code while following DRs.

**When to use:** Writing code, implementing features, building according to design decisions.

**Key activities:**

- Implement according to DRs
- Reference DRs in code comments
- Write tests
- Flag design gaps if discovered

### [code-review.md](./code-review.md)

Guides agents through comprehensive code review, ensuring correctness, maintainability, and alignment with Design Records.

**When to use:** Reviewing code for quality, verifying implementation matches design, identifying issues before deployment.

**Key activities:**

- Review code against Design Records
- Analyze correctness, design, and quality
- Check error handling and testing
- Create rectification project for issues found

## How to Use Task Documents

**In AGENTS.md or project documents:**
Reference the appropriate task when you want agents to focus on specific work:

```markdown
## Current Task

Read docs/tasks/design-phase.md and help make design decisions for the authentication system.
```

```markdown
## Implementation

Follow docs/tasks/implementation-phase.md to implement the features defined in P-001.
```

**As standalone instructions:**
Task documents are self-contained - an agent can read just the task document and understand what to do.

## Creating New Task Documents

If you identify other types of work that would benefit from focused agent guidance, create new task documents here.

Format: `task-name.md`

Each task document should:

- Define the objective
- Explain the agent's role
- Provide workflow steps
- Include specific instructions for agents
- Reference relevant guides and resources
