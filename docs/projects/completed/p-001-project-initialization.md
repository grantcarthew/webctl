# P-001: Project Initialization

- Status: Completed
- Started: 2025-12-11
- Completed: 2025-12-11

## Overview

This is the initialization project for a new repository using the Documentation Driven Development (DDD) template. The goal is to transition this generic template into a specific, active software project by gathering requirements from the user and populating the core documentation.

## Agent Instructions

As the AI Agent working on this project, your goal is to "interview" the user and then set up the project. Follow these steps:

1. **Context Gathering (The Interview):**
    - Ask the user for the **Project Name**.
    - Ask for a **High-Level Description** (What are we building?).
    - Ask about the **Target Tech Stack** (Languages, Frameworks).
    - Ask for the **First Major Milestone** (What is the first tangible thing to build?).

2. **Documentation Updates:**
    - **Update `README.md`**: Replace the template intro with the new Project Name and Description. Keep the "DDD" section at the bottom as a reference, but make the top about the actual project.
    - **Update `AGENTS.md`**: Update the `[Project Name]` and Description placeholders.

3. **Project Planning:**
    - Based on the "First Major Milestone" identified in the interview, create **P-002**.
    - Use the standard project template (`docs/projects/p-writing-guide.md`).
    - Ensure P-002 has clear goals, success criteria, and deliverables.

4. **Handover:**
    - Move this file (P-001) to `docs/projects/completed/`.
    - Update `AGENTS.md` to set `Active Project: docs/projects/p-002-....md`.
    - Inform the user that the project is initialized and ready for P-002.

## Goals

1. Understand the user's intent for this repository.
2. Remove generic template placeholders from root documentation.
3. Define the first concrete work package (P-002).

## Success Criteria

- [x] User has provided project name, description, and tech stack.
- [x] `README.md` accurately describes the new project.
- [x] `AGENTS.md` accurately describes the new project.
- [x] `docs/projects/p-002-*.md` exists and is well-formed.
- [x] `AGENTS.md` points to P-002 as the Active Project.

## Deliverables

- Updated `README.md`
- Updated `AGENTS.md`
- New `docs/projects/p-002-[milestone-name].md`
