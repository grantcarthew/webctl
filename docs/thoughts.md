# Thoughts

This document is a space for brainstorming, capturing ideas, asking questions, and exploring possibilities. Use it freely for any thoughts that don't yet warrant a formal Design Record. When an idea matures into a concrete decision, create a DR in `design/design-records/`.

- The terminal stops showing text when typing after exiting webctl. I have to `reset` to fix it.
