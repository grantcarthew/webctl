# Task: Active Project Review

Review the active project document to set the stage for a successful project outcome.

## Repository Analysis

Analyse the following:

- Code files
- Documentation
- Work required to implement the project

## Research

If needed, research:

- Current versions of dependencies and packages
- API documentation for external services
- Best practices for the approach being taken
- Known issues or compatibility concerns

## Expectation

- Ensure the project includes a Current State section with relevant codebase context
- Ensure the project includes a Decision Points section if owner decisions are needed
- Only add decision points that would block or significantly affect implementation
- Report findings and update the document if needed

## Decision Points

- You may find decisions need to be made to complete the project
- This is normal and expected
- Leave decisions to the owner
- Use numbered questions with lettered options (e.g., "1. A", "2. B")
