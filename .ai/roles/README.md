# Roles

This directory contains role definitions that shape AI agent behaviour and personality.

Role documents define system prompts, constraints, and behavioural guidelines. They're meant to be read by agents at the start of a session to establish how they should operate.

## Creating Role Documents

Format: `role-name.md`

Each role document should:

- Define the agent's identity and purpose
- Establish behavioural guidelines
- Specify constraints and boundaries
- Include relevant domain knowledge
